## Experience ##

### Distinguished Engineer / Broadcom, San Jose, CA 2005 � 2016 ###

Planning for the next five years of networking ICs, particularly for time-sensitive networking. Definition 
of possible product lines, review of IC functionality and testing, enabling and creation of cross-industry 
networking standards and protocols. Leader of IEEE 802.1 AVB and TSN groups, attempted simplification 
of Ethernet connection standards (�Nu45�) which, unfortunately did not happen � but something 
similar was done for USB-C.

### Principal / Plumblinks, Santa Cruz, CA 2004 � 2005 ###

Consulting on Firewire applications and technology, time-sensitive Ethernet protocols and architectures. 
Customers included Broadcom, Oxford Semiconductor and Pioneer Electronics. Creation of IEEE 802.1 
Audio Video Bridging task group.

### Plumbing Architect / Apple, Cupertino, CA 2002 � 2004 ###

Go-to person for Firewire technology and applications. Creation of improved IEEE 1394 standards 
(including IEEE 1394c), attempted merger of IEEE 1394 and 802 technologies, but no one at Apple was 
interested.

### CTO / Zayante, Scotts Valley, CA 1997 � 2002 ###

One of the founders of the corporation, including initial product planning and negotiations of original 
contract for $850,000 that launched the company. Technical leadership and primary communicator of 
Zayante�s system and software technology.  Continued 1394 evangelism, including successful effort to 
get Intel to join the 1394 effort. Major technical contributions to 1394b long-haul and high-speed 
updates as well as Zayante�s own 1394 hardware and software implementations. Initial definition of the 
integration of 1394 into  Ethernet and 802.11-based networks. Helped negotiate purchase of the

SOCIETY OF AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERS - APRIL 2015

With the explosion of demand for connectivity and multimedia in the automobile, the need for 
standards-based A/V networking that can be easily deployed is now well-established. The IEEE 802.1 
Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) Task Group1 and several other related IEEE Working Groups have developed 
a series of network enhancements that provide the components for highly reliable audio and video 
applications. This paper outlines these new technologies and their benefits when used for in-vehicle 
applications.

SAE - JANUARY 2013

Traditional IT-based networks, such as Ethernet, have been poor choices in the past for automotive use. 
In particular, the lack of deterministic (and small) delays has prevented Ethernet from making significant 
inroads into control systems. Various proprietary systems based on Ethernet components have shown 
that it is possible to architect such networks, but until very recently, there were no standards to 
guarantee interoperability. Fortunately, the IEEE 802 working groups have been developing new 
specifications to enable "time sensitive networks" that are interoperable, compatible with existing IT 
networks, and that will meet the requirements of automotive and industrial control systems. This paper 
outlines the technology behind the new specifications and describes how they can be used to build 
unified automotive networks for both control and infotainment applications. Compatibility and 
coexistence with CAN and FlexRay were also be discussed.

### *[Using an IEEE 802.1AS Network as a Distributed IEEE 1588 Boundary, Ordinary, or Transparent Clock](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5609779)* ###

IEEE - SEPTEMBER 2010

IEEE 802.1AS includes a very specific profile of IEEE 1588 that only runs at layer 2 over networks that 
follow the IEEE 802 architecture. It has some significant performance and scalability advantages, but at 
the cost of not allowing non-PTP-aware devices. This paper describes how a network having a common 
source of time can act as a distributed IEEE 1588 boundary, ordinary, or transparent clock, allowing the 
network to transport synchronization between portions of an IEEE 1588 network domain, and do this for 
any number of domains simultaneously. The network that acts as a distributed clock can be a PTP 
network supporting a profile that is different from that of the domains whose timing it is transporting. 
As one example, an IEEE 802.1AS network can act as a distributed IEEE 1588 boundary, ordinary, or 
transparent clock. As part of the discussion, the paper also shows that an IEEE 1588 boundary clock and 
peer-to-peer transparent clock are functionally equivalent in the manner in which they transport 
synchronization, and that the principal difference between the two is that the former invokes a best 
master clock algorithm (either default or alternate) and implements the full PTP state machine, while 
the latter does not. The concepts of distributed BC, TC, and OC, and the equivalence of the BC and peer-
to-peer TC may be considered a new way of looking at the transport of synchronization in a network 
based on IEEE 1588.

### *[New Simulation and Test Results for IEEE 802.1AS Timing Performance](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5340214)*

2009 INTERNATIONAL IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON PRECISION CLOCK SYNCHRONIZATION FOR MEASUREMENT, 
CONTROL AND COMMUNICATION - OCTOBER 2009

IEEE 802.1AS is a standard being developed in the 802.1 Working Group to provide precise timing and 
synchronization for bridged networks. It is one of the 802.1 audio/video bridging (AVB) standards, and a 
major use of it will be to ensure that jitter, wander, and time synchronization requirements for time-
sensitive applications in a residential AVB network are met. However, 802.1AS (and the other AVB 
standards) can be used in other applications as well. Each application will be specified by an `AVB 
profile', and each profile will provide for very few options to simplify the configuration and operation by 
the user and result in low cost. IEEE 802.1AS includes an IEEE 802-specific layer-2 profile of IEEE Std. 
1588trade - 2008; plus additional specifications to allow transport over 802.11 (WiFi), Ethernet PONs, 
and coordinated shared networks such as MoCA; plus additional requirements needed to ensure timing 
performance. IEEE 802.1AS is nearing completion, and is expected to be balloted by 4Q2009. This paper 
gives a brief overview of IEEE 802.1AS, focusing on recent developments. It then describes new 
simulation modeling and results for jitter, wander, and synchronization performance. Finally, it describes 
performance test results using 802.1AS bridges and end-stations.
